I have a notification model with fields, id, title, message, is_read, entity_type, entity_id. entity type could be other model name like ServiceRequest, ServiceOffer, Contract. when service request or contract is created a notification will also be created. on status change of service offer or contract a notification will also be created. service request and contract creation notification will be visible to all users with role "Supplier Representative" or "Contract Coordinator". only supplier representative can bid on a service request and a service offer will be created. so service offer status change notification will be visible only to specific user who created the service offer. similarly only contract coordinator can bid on a contract. so contract status change notification will be visible only to specific user who bid on the contract. for your clarification I am providing you a structure or relation between this models:

class User(AbstructUser):

...

 role = models.CharField(....)

provider = models.ForeignKey('Provider', ...)



class Provider():

id =

name = 

....



class ServiceRequest():

....



class ServiceOffer():

service_request = models.ForeignKey('ServiceRequest'....)

provider = models.ForeignKey('Provider'...)

status = models.CharField(...)

...



class Contract():

provider = models.ForeignKey('Provider'....)

status = models.CharField(...)

....



so now please modify notification model if required, create serializer, and views please.
